# 🌿 Digital Naturalist - AI Enabled tool for Biodiversity Researchers

- TECHNOLOGY : Artificial Intelligence

# 📒 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

A naturalist is someone who studies the patterns of nature, identifies a different kind of flora and fauna in nature.Being able to identify the flora and fauna around us often leads to an interest in protecting wild spaces, and collecting and sharing information about the species we see on our travels is very useful for conservation groups like NCC.

When venturing into the woods, field naturalists usually rely on common approaches like always carrying a guidebook around everywhere or seeking help from experienced ornithologists. There should be a handy tool for them to capture, identify and share the beauty to the outside world. 

Field naturalists can only use this web app from anywhere to identify the birds, flowers, mammals and other species they see on their hikes, canoe trips and other excursions.


In this project, we are creating a web application which uses a deep learning model, trained on different species of birds, flowers and mammals (2 subclasses in each for a quick understanding)and get the prediction of the bird when an image is been given.
